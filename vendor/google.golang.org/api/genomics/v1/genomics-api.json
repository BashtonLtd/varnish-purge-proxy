      "description": "A read alignment describes a linear alignment of a string of DNA to a\nreference sequence, in addition to metadata\nabout the fragment (the molecule of DNA sequenced) and the read (the bases\nwhich were read by the sequencer). A read is equivalent to a line in a SAM\nfile. A read belongs to exactly one read group and exactly one\nread group set.\n\nFor more genomics resource definitions, see [Fundamentals of Google\nGenomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics)\n\n### Reverse-stranded reads\n\nMapped reads (reads having a non-null `alignment`) can be aligned to either\nthe forward or the reverse strand of their associated reference. Strandedness\nof a mapped read is encoded by `alignment.position.reverseStrand`.\n\nIf we consider the reference to be a forward-stranded coordinate space of\n`[0, reference.length)` with `0` as the left-most position and\n`reference.length` as the right-most position, reads are always aligned left\nto right. That is, `alignment.position.position` always refers to the\nleft-most reference coordinate and `alignment.cigar` describes the alignment\nof this read to the reference from left to right. All per-base fields such as\n`alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` share this same left-to-right\norientation; this is true of reads which are aligned to either strand. For\nreverse-stranded reads, this means that `alignedSequence` is the reverse\ncomplement of the bases that were originally reported by the sequencing\nmachine.\n\n### Generating a reference-aligned sequence string\n\nWhen interacting with mapped reads, it's often useful to produce a string\nrepresenting the local alignment of the read to reference. The following\npseudocode demonstrates one way of doing this:\n\n    out = \"\"\n    offset = 0\n    for c in read.alignment.cigar {\n      switch c.operation {\n      case \"ALIGNMENT_MATCH\", \"SEQUENCE_MATCH\", \"SEQUENCE_MISMATCH\":\n        out += read.alignedSequence[offset:offset+c.operationLength]\n        offset += c.operationLength\n        break\n      case \"CLIP_SOFT\", \"INSERT\":\n        offset += c.operationLength\n        break\n      case \"PAD\":\n        out += repeat(\"*\", c.operationLength)\n        break\n      case \"DELETE\":\n        out += repeat(\"-\", c.operationLength)\n        break\n      case \"SKIP\":\n        out += repeat(\" \", c.operationLength)\n        break\n      case \"CLIP_HARD\":\n        break\n      }\n    }\n    return out\n\n### Converting to SAM's CIGAR string\n\nThe following pseudocode generates a SAM CIGAR string from the\n`cigar` field. Note that this is a lossy conversion\n(`cigar.referenceSequence` is lost).\n\n    cigarMap = {\n      \"ALIGNMENT_MATCH\": \"M\",\n      \"INSERT\": \"I\",\n      \"DELETE\": \"D\",\n      \"SKIP\": \"N\",\n      \"CLIP_SOFT\": \"S\",\n      \"CLIP_HARD\": \"H\",\n      \"PAD\": \"P\",\n      \"SEQUENCE_MATCH\": \"=\",\n      \"SEQUENCE_MISMATCH\": \"X\",\n    }\n    cigarStr = \"\"\n    for c in read.alignment.cigar {\n      cigarStr += c.operationLength + cigarMap[c.operation]\n    }\n    return cigarStr",

      "description": "The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different\nprogramming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by\n[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,\nand error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",
